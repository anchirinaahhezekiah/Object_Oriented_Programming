### 📝 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) C++ Projects** repository! This folder contains **five C++ projects**, each demonstrating core **OOP principles** such as **encapsulation, classes, and methods**. These projects focus on solving mathematical and computational problems using OOP techniques.  

### 📂 Projects Included  

1. **Area of a Circle** – Calculates the area of a circle given the radius.  
2. **Area of a Cube** – Computes the surface area of a cube using its side length.  
3. **Area of a Rectangle** – Determines the area of a rectangle given its length and width.  
4. **Area of a Triangle** – Computes the area of a triangle using base and height.  
5. **Program for Matrix Calculation** – Performs matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  

### 🚀 How to Run the Projects  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anchirinaahhezekiah/Object_Oriented_Programming.git
   cd Object_Oriented_Programming
   ```
2. **Compile and Run a Specific Project**  
   ```bash
   g++ project_name.cpp -o project_name
   ./project_name
   ```

### 📜 Features  
- Developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
- Utilizes **classes and functions** for modular and reusable code.  
- **User-friendly input and output** for easy interaction.
